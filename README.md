## How it works
Allows NGL  accounts to be spammed with pre-written questions. The APP can handle maximum 15 questions, but it will only send 10 questions, because some questions didn't delivered. When it successfully sent the questions, the program waits 10 seconds so that the site does not detect it as spam. After this time, it will send the question to the next account. When it reaches the end, its start from the beginning.

## How To Use!!

I recommend that you take a detailed look at the tutorial on YouTube, as it is the best and everything is explained there. If you make one mistake, the entire program may not work, and it could even damage some strings.

1.First you need the NGL account name. You can find the name after the "@" character. Or in the url field.
If it differs, copy the name from the address bar of the browser, because the accounts can have the same name.
2.Then copy the name into the **accounts.txt**. There is no limit to how many names you can enter!

3.After you done all those things, you can start the program

**If you want to ensure that the account checking step is always skipped**, you can modify the **MD5.md5** file to contain the value **0**. This will effectively bypass the step regardless if the accounts.txt file has changed.
